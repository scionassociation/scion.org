## SCION Standardization

The goal of the SCION Association is to establish the SCION Internet Architecture
as a global Internet standard. To that extent, the SCION Association collaborates
with internet standard organizations such as the IETF, ITU, and ENISA to
publish and continuously further develop SCION standard documents. These
documents allow enterprises to create SCION-compatible products and services.
