## SCION Open-Source Development

As part of the SCION Association initiative, the Association is maintaining an
open source reference implementation of the SCION core protocol and its
extensions. The code follows the SCION standard defined by the association and is
therefore compatible with other standard-compliant implementations of SCION.

Currently, the SCION open source project contains the following protocols and
services:

- SCION core protocol (including border router, control service, SCION daemon
  and dispatcher)
- SCION IP gateway, for bridging SCION and IP networks
- Colibri QoS service
- DRKey
- Hidden paths service
