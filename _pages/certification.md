## SCION Certification

The SCION Association is currently building a certification institute to test a
wide variety of devices and services such as network appliances, ISPs and IXPs for
their compatability with SCION. When a product or service passes rigorous
testing by the certification institute, it is granted the right to carry the SCION
certified logo. The SCION logo is proof that the given product implements the SCION
specification and therefore meets high standards regarding user experience and
seamless compatibility with other SCION certified products and services.


**A company must be a member of the SCION Association and achieve
certification in order to use the SCION certified logo.**
