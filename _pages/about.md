## The Association

The SCION Association is a non-profit organisation driving transformation of the Internet infrastructure. It enables highly available, trustworthy, transparent, efficient, and affordable communication; ensuring reliable and secure transport of data throughout global networks. The Association promotes collaboration within the ecosystem, sharing know-how with its members, facilitating open source development, while enabling that implementations are reliable, secure, and interoperable thanks to standardisation and a certification program.

The SCION Association was founded jointly by ETH Zurich and Dr. Uli Sigg on 24. August 2022 with its headquarters located in Lucerne. Prof. Dr. Vanessa Wood, Dr. Ulrich Sigg and Prof. Dr. Reto Francioni are appointed as the initial members of the Association Board. Patrick Naef becomes the CEO of the Association.

The SCION Association is now open for membership to entities interested in SCION. The Association is also globally recruiting further members of the Association and Advisory Board. Extensive communication will follow in early 2023 as soon as the Association Board and the Advisory Board are fully constituted.
