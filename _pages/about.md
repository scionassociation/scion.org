## Our Vision
Enabling highly available, trustworthy, transparent, efficient, and affordable communication; ensuring reliable and secure transport of electronic data assets throughout global networks.

## Our Mission

The SCION Association is a non-profit organisation facilitating the global adoption of the SCION next generation Internet to meet the growing requirements for reliability, security, performance, and compliance in the digital economy, fueled by the  proliferation of and dependency on interconnected machines, devices and people.

SCION strives to stabilize digital markets and democratize secure access to the Internet around the globe, while being compliant with data privacy requirements of businesses, their customers and other stakeholders.

The Foundation brings innovation developed at ETH Zurich to the market, making SCION research widely available.

The Foundation nurtures the growth of a global SCION ecosystem, promotes open source and open standards that allow anyone to succeed, making SCION accessible to everyone. The Foundation defines and promotes standards so that implementations are reliable, secure, and interoperable.


## Operation

We work towards our goal by focussing on three main areas:

- SCION Standardization
- SCION Open-Source Development
- SCION Certification

Each stream is discussed in more detail below.

### SCION Standardization

The goal of the SCION Association is to establish the SCION internet architecture
as a global internet standard. To that extent, the SCION Association collaborates
with internet standard organizations such as the IETF, ITU, and ENISA to
publish and continuously further develop SCION standard documents. These
documents allow enterprises to create SCION-compatible products and services.

### SCION Open-Source Development

As part of the SCION Association initiative, the foundation is maintaining an
open source reference implementation of the SCION core protocol and its
extensions. The code follows the SCION standard defined by the foundation and is
therefore compatible with other standard-compliant implementations of SCION.

Currently, the SCION open source project contains the following protocols and
services:

- SCION core protocol (including border router, control service, SCION daemon
  and dispatcher)
- SCION IP gateway, for bridging SCION and IP networks
- Colibri QoS service
- DRKey
- Hidden paths service

### SCION Certification

The SCION Association is currently building a certification institute to test a
wide variety of devices and services such as network appliances, ISPs and IXPs for
their compatability with SCION. When a product or service passes rigorous
testing by the certification institute, it is granted the right to carry the SCION
certified logo. The SCION logo is proof that the given product implements the SCION
specification and therefore meets high standards regarding user experience and
seamless compatibility with other SCION certified products and services.


**A company must be a member of the SCION Association and achieve
certification in order to use the SCION certified logo.**
